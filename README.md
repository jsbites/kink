## Unmaintained Software

This was just an **experimental** project, and it turned out that explicitly using redux functions such as `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` was much easier to manage than hiding things behind the veil. 

Iâ€™m not planning to contribute to this project for a while.

It is possible that I may use the namespace for a totally new project.

If you have any concerns or comments, [please let me know](mailto:volkan.io).

Thanks,

Volkan.
